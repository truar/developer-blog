    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>On a professional side</h2>
    <p>I am one of these developers with a passion for great code. I have experience in different sectors like
      manufacturing, luxury... where I developed my skills as a fullstack developer, developing RESTFul applications
      with microservice architectures. My curiosity and open-mindedness brought me into the energy sector, where I took
      the role of Data Engineer and faced new challenges like distributed computing and performance constraints.</p>
    <p>I have evolved as a Scrum master in agile teams, as I care about always improving the team I am part of. From my
      point of view, using serious games during team retrospectives is a key factor of success for the team evolution.
      Technical excellence is at the heart of my personality and I organize “mob programming” sessions with the entire
      team. I also lead monthly Coding session initiative in Zenika.</p>
    <p>
      I have talked about GreenIT and IT revolutions at conferences. Speaking
      in public is a source of motivation and helps me giving my best.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>I am also a trainer on various subject, like</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spring Core as an official Spring Core trainer</li>
      <li>Javascript for beginners</li>
      <li>Java for beginner and advanced developers</li>
      <li>Discovering Software craftsmanship, we cover topics like TDD, eXtreme Programming and Code smells with hands
        on labs in Pair Programming or Mob Programming
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>And on a more personal side</h2>
    <p>I come from Annecy, the beautiful city I was born in. I grew up entirely in Haute-Savoie, also during my first
      step into the student world, where I studied IT at the technical institute of Annecy-le-Vieux</p>
    <p>I like sports in general. Growing in Haute-Savoie, I don't remember the first time I stepped on my skis... I was
      very young I guess. I was a dedicated handball player for over 13 years. I then decided to practice a bit of
      tennis, which I like playing occasionally with my friends and family.
    </p>
    <p>I recently started enjoying KiteSurf, that I like to practice on a more regular basis. But living in Paris makes
      it a bit complicated. Anyway, I like enjoying a Week-End in Normandie when the wind is favorable to enjoy some
      gliding feelings.</p>
