# Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
## What is the concept of AOP? Which problem does it solve? What is a cross cutting concern?

Aspect Oriented Programming is the concept of weaving extra behavior during the application execution. The purpose is to solve cross-cutting concerns with a modular approach. 

A cross-cutting concern is a concern that impacts every layer and class of your application. You need to be able to recognize requirements that needs to be solved by AOP:
* Log a message before **every** data modification.
* Check the access roles **for each** methods in the `MemberService`

### Name three typical cross cutting concerns.

Typical cross-cutting concerns are:
* Transactions
* Security
* Caching
* Monitoring 

### What two problems arise if you donâ€™t solve a cross cutting concern via AOP?

When not solving cross-cutting concerns with AOP you end up with 2 problems:
* **Code scattering**: Mix & Match of Security, transactional and business concerns, which blurs the intent and make the code hard to test. Code scattering violates the **Separation of Concerns principle**.
* **Code tangling**: The same code spreads all over your code base, which is harder to evolve and maintain. Code tangling violates the **Don't Repeat Yourself principle**.

## What is a pointcut, a join point, an advice, an aspect, weaving?

* **JoinPoint**: The point in the program where you want to execute your advice. Is it on a method ? On a specific class ? Only methods annotated by `@...`.
* **Pointcut**: An expression targeting a  set of JoinPoints following the Pointcut Expression.
* Advice: When do you want to execute, and what you want to execute. In Java, an Advice is simply a method.
* **Aspect**: A module grouping the extra behavior to enhance the class. Example: SecurityAspect, TransactionalAspect, LoggingAspect... In Java, an Aspect is a class composing of methods (the advices)
* **Weaving**: Technology used to dynamically call the **advices** when the execution matches the **JoinPoints** definition.

## How does Spring solve (implement) a cross cutting concern?

Spring implements a Cross-cutting concern using a proxy. When a bean is the target of JoinPoints, Spring wraps the bean around a Proxy to intercept the call and execute the advices.

## Which are the limitations of the two proxy-types?

* JDK Proxy can only proxied a class implementing an interface.
* CGLib Proxy can not proxied a final class or method.

### What visibility must Spring bean methods have to be proxied using Spring AOP?

Spring AOP only supports methods with non-private visibility. 

## How many advice types does Spring support? Can you name each one?

Spring supports 5 types of advice:
* `@Before`: Execute the advice before entering the target method.
> Note you can block the target execution by throwing an exception in the advice method. Example with Security check, where you can prevent the user accessing a method if it doesn't have the proper roles.

* `@AfterReturning`: Execute the advice after the target method returns a result
> The target method has to return, not throw an exception.

* `@AfterThrowing`: Execute the advice after the target method throws an Exception.
> Note the AfterThrowing advice can't block the exception. It can send a new Exception or the same one, but it must throws. If it doesn't throw, then the exception from the target method is automatically thrown.

* `@After`: Execute the advice no matter how the methods terminated. We don't know of it is a success or exception case, but we can execute code if we need to.

* `@Around`: Completely control the target method execution. The advice is in charge of calling the target method manually. If the advice does not call the target, then the target will not be reached.

### What are they used for?
See point above.
### Which two advices can you use if you would like to try and catch exceptions?

To try and catch exceptions, you can use:
* `@Around` advice: You can try and catch the exception sent by the target method around the target method call in the advice.
* `@AfterThrowing` advice: You can catch the exception and send a new one if you need to, after the target has thrown an exception.

## If shown pointcut expressions, would you understand them?
### For example, in the course we matched getter methods on Spring Beans, what would be the correct pointcut expression to match both getter and setter methods?

To match getters and setters, you could use the pointcut expressions:
```java
execution(* set*(*)) || execution(* get())
```

## What is the JoinPoint argument used for?

The JoinPoint argument is used to manipulate the target object and the arguments passed by the caller to the target method. The JoinPoint needs to be used with a defensive pogramming, as it relies on `Object` when manipulating the API.

## What is a ProceedingJoinPoint? Which advice type is it used with?

A `ProceesdingJoinPoint` is used in an `@Around` advice. It gives the advice the possibility to continue the execution flow by calling:
```java
proceedingJoinPoint.proceed();
```
